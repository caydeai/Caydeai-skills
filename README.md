# Caydeai-skills

Public skill library from the [CaydeAI](https://caydeai.carrd.co) build.

Skills are reusable instruction packages for Claude — modular capabilities you can drop into Claude Code or any Claude surface. This repo holds the free ones.

## What's here

Each top-level folder is a self-contained skill. Drop the folder into your `~/.claude/skills/` directory and Claude will pick it up automatically.

Coming soon:
- `session-wrap-up` — end-of-session memory + decision log writer
- `daily-briefing` — research synthesis briefing builder
- `etsy-keyword-scout` — Etsy niche research from public API data

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/caydeai/Caydeai-skills.git
cp -r Caydeai-skills/<skill-name> ~/.claude/skills/
```

Restart Claude Code. The skill loads on next session.
